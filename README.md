# AI Banking Assistant Orchestrator

## Overview
This project is a simple AI-powered banking assistant designed using an orchestration approach.

## Problem
Banking assistants must answer only relevant questions and avoid unsafe or unrelated responses.

## Workflow
1. User submits a question
2. System checks if the question is banking-related
3. If yes → AI generates an answer
4. If no → AI responds with a safe refusal
5. Decision is logged

## Why AI Orchestration?
AI is not called blindly. Rule-based checks control when and how AI responds.

## Tools Used
- Python
- OpenAI API 
- Basic rule-based logic
